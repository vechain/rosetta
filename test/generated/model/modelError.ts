It MUST NOT be populated with information about a particular instantiation of an error (use `details` for this).  Whereas the content of Error.Message should stay stable across releases, the content of Error.Description will likely change across releases (as implementers improve error documentation). For this reason, the content in this field is not part of any type assertion (unlike Error.Message).
